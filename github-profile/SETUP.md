# How to use this on your GitHub profile

Your GitHub profile README is shown when someone visits **https://github.com/saichakravarthi-n**. It comes from a **special repo** with the **same name as your username**.

## Steps

1. **Create the profile repo**
   - Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
   - **Repository name:** type exactly `saichakravarthi-n` (same as your username)
   - Set visibility to **Public**
   - Check **"Add a README file"** (you’ll replace it)
   - Click **Create repository**

2. **Replace the README**
   - In that repo, open `README.md` and click the **pencil (Edit)** icon
   - Copy everything from this folder’s `README.md` and paste it (replace existing content)
   - Edit the placeholder text:
     - Your name, title, and short bio
     - LinkedIn, Twitter, portfolio URLs (or remove badges you don’t use)
     - “Tech & tools” — add/remove languages and tools you actually use
   - Commit with a message like: `Update profile README`

3. **Optional: add a profile picture and bio**
   - On GitHub: click your avatar (top right) → **Your profile**
   - Click **Edit profile**
   - Set **Profile picture**, **Name**, **Bio**, **Location**, **Website**, and **Social accounts**

After this, anyone visiting **https://github.com/saichakravarthi-n** will see your new profile README and stats.
